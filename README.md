# Weather-Application-using-OpenWeatherAPI

ABSTRACT: The idea and purpose of this project is to create a Weather Application which is based on Windows platform. This project enables us to make an API call to https://openweathermap.org/  and parses the data provided by them into Json format. It allows us to toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius. It parses an xml file for saving data purpose. It is meant to run in a background thread. Therefore, it is very useful for integrating into another code. It uses Win32 API and CMake to implement the code. Code could be configured to make it compatible to different weather services. Json formatted data could not be used directly into a program so I had to use a Json package extractor to convert json format data into program readable language. This data is then used in the application to show multiple reports related to weather forecasting. The data shown in my app include current temperature, wind speed and direction, pressure, latitude and longitude, and many more reports.
